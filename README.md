# DeCentraLand

## Tagline
Web3 Marketplace for lands

## The problem it solves
My project DeCentra-Land is basically a decentralised property exchange platform for buying and selling of lands and properties.
Each land can be represented as a NFT which shows the ownership of the property and can be used for selling or buying 


### Challenges I ran into
Challenges I ran into were using a proper mechanism for Authentication
Looking for the use case of Dynamic NFTs
Trying to create a user friendly interface
